You only need to install the application on your Android mobile device and record each wild animal you observed. {{mobileLinkStart}}SmartBirds&nbsp;Pro{{mobileLinkEnd}} is user-friendly both for professionals during a specialized monitoring and for single-observations by nature enthusiasts. Detailed <strong>instructions on how to use the application are available {{instructionLinkStart}}here{{instructionLinkEnd}}</strong>.",

It contains photos of the birds, maps with their distribution in Bulgaria and information on what they look like, what they feed on, what habitats they prefer, and where in Bulgaria they can be observed. A brief information about their breeding, periods of migration, their conservation status, and the threats they are facing. The description and the coordinates of the sites of Natura 2000 will help you find the locations closest to you to observe birds.",
